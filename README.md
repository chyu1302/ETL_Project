# ETL_Project
Data Cleanup &amp; Analysis
Project time limit: a week
Data sources: two csv files (one from New York Stock Exchange and one from data.world) and matching up the fundamentals listed by ticker symbol with actual company name. 
This would be valuable in a real life scenario if an investment manager was looking for companies on the New York Stock Exchange and who was also looking to have a database where they could look up company ratios and find their actual name instead of ticker symbol.
